    <p>Vee Validate is a plugin for Vue that extends Element UI to enable pluggable validators by way of drivers.</p>
    <p>This means you don't have to use Element's built-in Async Validator with its verbose syntax; you can use alternative validation engines, such as Vee Validator to validate forms with a more concise syntax:</p>
    <pre>required|alpha|min:2|max:5</pre>
    <p>Additionally, the Vee Validate driver provides item-relative and form-relative validation messages, which makes by-item error messages more readable for the user.</p>
    <p>Finally, the driver setup is designed to be flexible; not only can you assign drivers on a per-form basis (which helps with a progressive, site-wide migration) but you can even swap out drivers at run-time â€“ as per this demo!</p>
    <p>Check out the demos and review the source code to see Vee Element's features in action.</p>
