# Vee Element Demo

A simple demo, based on the [form validation demo](https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/form#validation) on the Element UI site.

## Getting started

To run the demo locally, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davestewart/vee-element
cd vee-element/demo
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Notes

- Flip between Async Validator and Vee Validate by toggling the buttons at the top of the demo

- Check `config/rules.js` to compare rules styles

- Check `config/validator.js` to see how to configure custom rules
